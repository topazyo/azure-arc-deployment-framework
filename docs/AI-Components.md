        Identifies anomalous behavior
        
        Returns:
        - Anomaly score
        - Affected components
        - Severity level
        """
```

## Integration

### 1. PowerShell Integration

The framework integrates AI capabilities through several PowerShell functions. Key functions include:

- **Core Functions**:
    - `Initialize-ArcDeployment`: Sets up the initial parameters for an Arc deployment.
    - `New-ArcDeployment`: Deploys a new Arc agent to a server.
- **AI Functions**:
    - `Get-PredictiveInsights`: Retrieves predictive insights for a given server. Currently, this function returns placeholder data pending full AI model integration.
    - `Invoke-AIPatternAnalysis`: Analyzes telemetry data to identify patterns.
    - `Start-AIEnhancedTroubleshooting`: Initiates an AI-driven troubleshooting workflow.

The module manifest (`AzureArcFramework.psd1`) correctly lists `Start-ArcTroubleshooter` as the function for initiating troubleshooting workflows.

```powershell
# Example: Initialize AI components (conceptual)
# $ai = Initialize-AIComponents -Config $AIConfig

# Get predictive insights for a server
$serverInsights = Get-PredictiveInsights -ServerName "MyArcServer"

# Analyze patterns from telemetry data
# $patterns = Invoke-AIPatternAnalysis -Data $telemetryData
```

### 2. Automation Integration

```powershell
# AI-driven remediation
Start-AIRemediationWorkflow -ServerName $ServerName -Insights $insights

# Automated decision making
Invoke-AIDecision -Context $context -Options $options
```

## Model Training

    C -->|Features| D[Model Training]
    D -->|Trained Model| E[Validation]
    E -->|Validated Model| F[Deployment]
```

### 2. Model Updates

```python
def update_model(new_data):
    """
    Updates model with new training data
    
    Parameters:
    - new_data: New training data
    
    Returns:
    - Updated model metrics
    """
```

## Python AI Engine Details

This section details recent updates to the core Python classes forming the AI engine. Many of these components are currently using placeholder logic and data, serving as a structural foundation for future full-fledged AI model integration.

### RootCauseAnalyzer
The `RootCauseAnalyzer` now initializes with placeholder instances for its machine learning model (`ml_model = MLModelPlaceholder()`) and its explanation component (`explainer = ExplainerPlaceholder()`). These placeholders simulate the behavior of a trained ML model and an explainable AI component, allowing the overall workflow to be tested.

### PatternAnalyzer
The `PatternAnalyzer` has been significantly expanded with several new methods to identify various types of patterns in telemetry data. These methods currently implement placeholder logic and return simulated pattern data:
- `analyze_daily_patterns`: Analyzes for daily trends and seasonality.
- `analyze_weekly_patterns`: Analyzes for weekly trends.
- `analyze_monthly_patterns`: Analyzes for monthly cycles.
- `identify_common_failure_causes`: Identifies frequent causes of failures.
- `identify_failure_precursors`: Detects sequences of events that may lead to failures.
- `analyze_failure_impact`: Assesses the potential impact of identified failures.
- `analyze_resource_usage_patterns`: Analyzes how resources are utilized over time.
- `identify_bottlenecks`: Pinpoints potential performance bottlenecks.
- `analyze_performance_trends`: Tracks trends in performance metrics.

The parent methods `analyze_failure_patterns` and `analyze_performance_patterns` have also been updated to include a `recommendations` key in their output, populated with placeholder recommendations.

### TelemetryProcessor
The `TelemetryProcessor` includes several new internal methods for processing telemetry data. These methods currently use placeholder logic:
- `_handle_missing_values`: Fills or removes missing data points.
- `_prepare_feature_matrix`: Transforms features into a numerical matrix for model input.
- `_get_anomalous_features`: Identifies features contributing to an anomaly.
- `_calculate_period_trends`: Calculates trends over specific time periods.
- `_detect_periodic_patterns`: Detects recurring patterns.
- `_detect_correlations`: Finds correlations between different metrics.
- `_detect_anomalous_patterns`: Identifies unusual sequences or combinations of events.
- `_generate_anomaly_insights`: Creates human-readable insights from detected anomalies.
- `_generate_trend_insights`: Creates insights from detected trends.
- `_calculate_derived_features`: Computes new features from existing data (e.g., error rates).

### ArcRemediationLearner & ArcModelTrainer
- **ArcRemediationLearner**: In the `learn_from_remediation` method, the model update call has been changed from `self.model.partial_fit(...)` to `self.model.fit(...)`. This reflects an iterative single-sample update approach suitable for the current placeholder model.
- **ArcModelTrainer**: A new placeholder method `update_models_with_remediation` has been added. This method is intended to eventually allow models to learn from the outcomes of remediation actions.

### FeatureEngineer
The `FeatureEngineer` component has received the following updates:
- In `_encode_categorical_features`, the `OneHotEncoder` initialization was changed from `sparse=False` to `sparse_output=False` to align with updated scikit-learn parameter names.
- In `_create_statistical_features`, methods for calculating rolling statistics (mean, std, max, min), lag features, difference features, and percentage change features now include `.fillna(0)` to handle NaN values that can arise at the beginning of series or from certain calculations.

### Predictor
The `Predictor` component's `calculate_feature_impacts` method has been updated to correctly use numerical indices when accessing feature values from the `prepared_features_array` (NumPy array). Previously, it attempted to use feature names, which would fail. The method now assumes the order of features in the `feature_importance` dictionary matches the column order in `prepared_features_array`. Warnings have been added to log potential issues if this order assumption is violated or if array dimensions don't match. The `prepare_features` method still uses hardcoded feature lists, and this dependency is acknowledged as a risk.

## Configuration

### 1. AI Configuration
The main AI configuration file, `src/config/ai_config.json`, has been updated to include new sections essential for the expanded AI capabilities:
- **`clustering`**: Configuration for pattern analysis clustering (e.g., `eps`, `min_samples` for DBSCAN in `PatternAnalyzer`).
- **`feature_engineering`**: Parameters for the `FeatureEngineer` (e.g., `rolling_window` size, `lags` to generate).
- **`model_config`**: Contains detailed configurations for model training, structured into:
    - `features`: Defines required features, missing value strategies, and target columns for different model types (`health_prediction`, `anomaly_detection`, `failure_prediction`).
    - `models`: Specifies hyperparameters for each model type (e.g., `n_estimators`, `max_depth` for Random Forest models, `contamination` for Isolation Forest).

```json
{
    "models": {
        "health_prediction": {
            "type": "RandomForest",
            "threshold": 0.7,
            "features": ["cpu", "memory", "network"]
        },
        "anomaly_detection": {
            "type": "IsolationForest",
            "contamination": 0.1
        }

        "epochs": 10,
        "validation_split": 0.2
    }
